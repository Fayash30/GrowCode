## Description
The Online Coding Platform is a web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It serves as a platform where users can practice coding by solving a set of problems. Users can submit their code solutions to the problems, and the platform evaluates the code to determine if the logic is correct.
